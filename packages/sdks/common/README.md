# Devopness SDK - Common

This directory contains shared artifacts and resources used across all Devopness SDK projects, including the API specifications and other common assets.

## Auto-generated files

> **Do not edit `spec.json` manually.**

The `spec.json` file is an OpenAPI specification that is **automatically generated** from the Devopness API codebase and committed to this repository by CI workflows. Any manual changes to this file will be overwritten the next time the spec is regenerated.

If you'd like to propose changes to the API specification, please open an issue or start a discussion describing the desired behavior and expected API contract changes so the team can review and align before implementation.
