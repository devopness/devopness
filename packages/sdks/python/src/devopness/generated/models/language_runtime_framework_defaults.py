    Attributes:
        default_branch (str, optional): The version control branch that, by default, will be retrieved and deployed. This might be overriden by client apps API calls when actually triggering a new deployment.
        engine_version (str, optional): The language runtime engine version to be used to execute this application code on the deployed servers
        framework (str, optional): The base framework on top of which the application has been implemented - if any
        root_directory (str, optional): The relative directory where package manager&#39;s manifest files (&#x60;package.json&#x60;, &#x60;composer.json&#x60;, &#x60;yarn.lock&#x60;, etc) are located. It needs to be set for applications where the actual source code is not located in the top level directory of the repository.
        deployments_keep (int, optional): The number of deployment history, logs and artifacts to keep stored in both devopness servers and user&#39;s servers
        commands (LanguageRuntimeFrameworkCommands, optional):
        install_dependencies_command (str, optional, nullable): Indicates command that Devopness must execute to install application dependencies
        build_command (str, optional, nullable): The optional command that should be executed once during deployment to build the source code and get the application in a ready state
