    ApplicationRelation

    Attributes:
        id (int): Unique ID of the application
        project_id (int): Numeric ID of the project to which the application belongs to
        environment_id (int): Numeric ID of the environment to which the application belongs to
        created_by (int): The id of the user who created the application and to whom the application belongs
        name (str): The application&#39;s unique name
        repository (str): The full name of a repository (&#x60;repository_owner/repository_name&#x60;) containing the application source code.
        repository_name (str): The name part of a repository full name (&#x60;repository_owner/repository_name&#x60;)
        repository_owner (str): The owner part of a repository full name (&#x60;repository_owner/repository_name&#x60;)
        default_branch (str): The version control branch that, by default, will be used when a deployment is triggered and no other branch name is informed.
        programming_language (str): The programming language runtime environment to be used to serve the application. E.g.: if a front-end web app is developed using Node.js, but should be served statically (a SPA application, for instance) then this field value should be &#x60;html&#x60;.
        programming_language_human_readable (str): The human readable version of the programming language of the application.
        engine_version (str): The language runtime engine version to be used to execute this application on the deployed servers
        framework (str): The base framework on top of which the application has been implemented - it might have impact on the steps to be performed during application deployment
        framework_human_readable (str): The human readable version of the framework of the application.
        root_directory (str, optional, nullable): The relative directory where package manager&#39;s manifest files (&#x60;package.json&#x60;, &#x60;composer.json&#x60;, &#x60;yarn.lock&#x60;, etc) are located. It needs to be set for applications where the actual source code is not located in the top level directory of the repository.
        deployments_keep (int): The number of deployment history, logs and artifacts to keep stored in both devopness servers and user&#39;s servers. OR The number of deployment artifacts to be retained in the user&#39;s servers, making it easier and faster to rollback to previous versions
        install_dependencies_command (str, optional, nullable): Indicates command that Devopness must execute to install application dependencies
        build_command (str, optional, nullable): The optional command that should be executed once during deployment to build the source code and get the application in a ready state
        last_deployments (ApplicationLastDeployments, optional):
        credential (Credential, optional):
        created_at (str, optional): The date and time when the record was created
