    ApplicationUpdate

    Attributes:
        id (int): The unique ID of the given Application.
        name (str): The application&#39;s unique name. Must not be greater than 60 characters.
        build_command (str, optional): The optional command that should be executed once during deployment to build the source code and get the application in a ready state.
        engine_version (str): The language runtime engine version to be used to execute this application on the deployed servers. Must be at least 1 character. Must not be greater than 10 characters.
        framework (str): The base framework on top of which the application has been implemented - it might have impact on the steps to be performed during application deployment. Must not be greater than 30 characters.
        programming_language (str): The programming language runtime environment to be used to serve the application. E.g.: if a front-end web app is developed using Node.js, but should be served statically (a SPA application, for instance) then this field value should be &#x60;html&#x60;. Must not be greater than 30 characters.
        repository (str, optional): The full name of a repository (&#x60;repository_owner/repository_name&#x60;) containing the application source code. Must not be greater than 100 characters.
        credential_id (int, optional): Numeric ID of the credential to source provider where the repository is hosted. This field is required when &lt;code&gt;repository&lt;/code&gt; is present.
        root_directory (str, optional): The relative directory where package manager&#39;s manifest files (&#x60;package.json&#x60;, &#x60;composer.json&#x60;, &#x60;yarn.lock&#x60;, etc) are located. It needs to be set for applications where the actual source code is not located in the top level directory of the repository. Must start with one of &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt;.
        default_branch (str): The version control branch that, by default, will be used when a deployment is triggered and no other branch name is informed. Must not be greater than 200 characters.
        deployments_keep (int, optional): The number of deployment history, logs and artifacts to keep stored in both devopness servers and user&#39;s servers. OR The number of deployment artifacts to be retained in the user&#39;s servers, making it easier and faster to rollback to previous versions. Must be at least 1. Must not be greater than 10.
        install_dependencies_command (str, optional): Indicates command that Devopness must execute to install application dependencies.
