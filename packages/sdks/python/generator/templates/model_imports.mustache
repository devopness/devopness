{{!
    The template [ModelName] is necessary because the path to the model file being exported is not available during template rendering
    without using the vendorExtensions.x-py-model-imports, and it is not possible to rely on this vendor extension because during
    generation, models [ModelName]Plain are created, which are plain version of Pydantic models, used to improve the
    DX (developer experience) of the SDK, and this models is not recognized in the vendorExtensions.x-py-model-imports.

    This template system is resolved in a extra step in the build script.
