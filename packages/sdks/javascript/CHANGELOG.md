  ## ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Change

  ### What changed?

  All `<ResourceType>` services that were previously accessed through the `EnvironmentService` (such as `applications`) have been moved to their respective standalone services (e.g., `ApplicationService`). Properties like `application` no longer exist in `EnvironmentService`.

  ### Why was this change made?

  This refactor simplifies the SDK structure by consolidating all `<ResourceType>` methods into their respective services. It eliminates redundancy, improves maintainability, and makes the SDK more intuitive and aligned with common API design principles.

  ### Previous usage example

  Previously, creating an application required accessing the method through `environment.application`:

  ```ts
  const apiClient = new DevopnessApiClient();
  const options =
    await apiClient.environment.application.addEnvironmentApplication();
  ```

  ### New usage example

  Now, all application-related methods are available directly under `application`:

  ```ts
  const apiClient = new DevopnessApiClient();
  const options = await apiClient.application.addEnvironmentApplication();
  ```

  ### Impact & Migration Guide

  Update all references that use `environment.<resourceType>` to the new direct service call format.
  For example:

  ```ts
  // Before
  apiClient.environment.application.listEnvironmentApplications();

  // After
  apiClient.application.listEnvironmentApplications();
  ```

  Repeat this migration for all affected `<ResourceType>` services.

  ## ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Change

  ### What changed?

  All static data services have been consolidated into `StaticService`, removing individual static service properties like `applicationOptions`.

  ### Why was this change made?

  This refactor simplifies the SDK structure by consolidating all static data retrieval methods into a single service. This reduces redundancy, improves maintainability, and ensures a more intuitive API design.

  ### How was it used before?

  Previously, retrieving static data required calling specific static services, such as:

  ```ts
  const apiClient = new DevopnessApiClient();
  const options =
    await apiClient.static.applicationOptions.getStaticApplicationOptions();
  ```

  ### How should it be used now?

  Now, all static data methods are centralized under `StaticService`:

  ```ts
  const apiClient = new DevopnessApiClient();
  const options = await apiClient.static.getStaticApplicationOptions();
  ```

  ### Impact & Migration

  Replace all occurrences of static service calls, e.g., `static.applicationOptions.getStaticApplicationOptions()` with `static.getStaticApplicationOptions()`.

  - Removed the direct _team_memberships_ relation from EnvironmentRelation and ArchivedEnvironmentRelation.

  üîÑ Changes

  - Added the _resource_summary_ field to the EnvironmentRelation and ArchivedEnvironmentRelation.

  üìå Reason for Changes

  The _resource_summary_ field centralizes summary information about linked resources, replacing explicit relations with a standardized summary format.

  To retrieve a full list of team memberships, use the appropriate SDK method.

  If you need to determine the number of linked team memberships, use:

  ```ruby
    environment
      .resource_summary['team-membership']
        .summary
        .count
  ```

  üö® Breaking Changes

  - Removed: Direct resource relation fields from the Environment model:
    - applications
    - credentials
    - cron_jobs
    - daemons
    - network_rules
    - networks
    - servers
    - services
    - ssh_keys
    - ssl_certificates
    - virtual_hosts

  üîÑ Changes

  - Added: resource_summary field to the Environment model.

  üìå Reason for Changes

  The resource_summary field centralizes summary information about linked resources, replacing explicit relations with a standardized summary format.

  This change enhances efficiency by reducing response payload size while still providing resource count details.

  Each entry in resource_summary includes:

  - resource_type: The singular identifier of the resource.
  - resource_type_plural: The plural form of the resource type.
  - resource_type_human_readable: A user-friendly singular name.
  - resource_type_plural_human_readable: A user-friendly plural name.
  - summary.count: The number of linked resources.

  To retrieve full resource lists, use the appropriate SDK methods instead of relying on the Environment model.

  If the goal is to determine the number of linked resources, use:

  ```ruby
    environment
      .resource_summary
      .{resource-type}
      .summary
      .count
  ```

  üîÑ Changes

  - Added: resource_summary field to the ProjectRelation model.

  üìå Reason for Changes

  The resource_summary field provides a structured summary of linked resources (environments, teams, and roles) within a project relation.

  This ensures efficient access to resource counts without exposing full lists.

  Each entry in resource_summary includes:

  - resource_type: The singular identifier of the resource.
  - resource_type_plural: The plural form of the resource type.
  - resource_type_human_readable: A user-friendly singular name.
  - resource_type_plural_human_readable: A user-friendly plural name.
  - summary.count: The number of linked resources.

  For resource counts, use:

  ```ruby
    projectRelation
      .resource_summary
      .{resource-type}
      .summary
      .count
  ```

  üö® Breaking Changes

  - Removed: environments, teams, and roles fields from the Project model.

  üîÑ Changes

  - Added: resource_summary field to the Project model.

  üìå Reason for Changes

  The resource_summary field centralizes summary information about linked resources (environments, teams, and roles) within a project.

  Each resource in resource_summary is an object containing:

  - resource_type: Identifies the resource type.
  - resource_type_plural: Identifies the resource type in plural form.
  - resource_type_human_readable: Identifies the resource type in human readable form.
  - resource_type_plural_human_readable: Identifies the resource type in plural form in human readable form.
  - summary.count: Represents the number of linked resources.

  To retrieve full lists of environments, teams, or roles, use the appropriate SDK methods instead of relying on the Project model.

  If the goal is to determine the number of linked resources, use:

  ```ruby
    project
      .resource_summary
      .{resource-type}
