 * The subnet\'s type: `public` or `private`. A `public` subnet is typically used to host resources that have a public IP address and are accessible from the public internet. `Example`: a server hosting an API or web app. A `private` subnet is typically used to host resources that should not be accessible from the public internet, such as database servers or internal applications. A server in a private subnet will not have a public IP address associated to it.
