"""
This module is responsible for discovering and registering Devopness tools
from service classes into the MCP Server.

Each tool is defined as a static method starting with the prefix 'tool_'
and is extracted automatically. These tools are renamed with a final prefix
'devopness_' and added to the FastMCP server, making them available for use
by the LLM.

Call `register_tools(mcp_server)` to make all tools available.
