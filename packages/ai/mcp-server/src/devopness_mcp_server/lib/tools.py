    Usage:

    1. To deploy a service:
        - Call this function with `operation='deploy'`, providing a valid
          `pipeline_id` and optionally `server_ids`.
        - Example: devopness_deploy_service(
            operation='deploy',

            server_ids=[1, 2, 3]

    2. To list deployment pipelines for a service:
        - Call this function with `operation='list_pipelines'` and provide a valid
          `service_id`.
        - Example: devopness_deploy_service(
            operation='list_pipelines',
            service_id=123
        )

    3. To list linked servers for a service:
        - Call this function with `operation='list_linked_servers'` and provide a valid
          `service_id`.
