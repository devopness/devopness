## About Devopness

`Devopness` drastically simplifies the way we manage cloud applications and multi cloud infrastructure in a secure and productive way.

Deovpness allows AI Agents and humans to provision and manage cloud infrastructure and deploy applications to `AWS`, `Azure`, `DigitalOcean`, `GCP`, ..., and any other major cloud provider.

* Simplified role based access control and permisson management
* No surprise on your cloud provider bills, as we only deploy the infra that each team of humans or agents have permissions to
* Full control on what AI Agents can do on your DevOps and CI/CD workflows
* Full visibility, auditing and traceability on what has been done by each person or agent in your teams

We're making first-class software deployment and cloud infrastructure management tools accessible and affordable to everyone who is involved in software projects.
