**Changes**
- Added support for listing, creating, and deploying `daemon` and `virtual-host` resources.
- Improved resource listing instructions by switching from numbered to bullet-point format to prevent miscommunication.
- Enhanced `list-projects` and `list-environments` instructions to ensure LLMs request user confirmation before using `project_id` and `environment_id`.
