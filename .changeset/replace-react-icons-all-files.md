Update icons source from [@react-icons/all-files](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@react-icons/all-files) to [react-icons](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-icons)

Both libraries are from the same author, but all-files is a heavy dependency that needed to be installed from outside the npm registry

Using [react-icons](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-icons) is the recommended approach for this package's use case, according to their [docs](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/)
