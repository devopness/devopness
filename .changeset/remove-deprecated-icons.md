Remove deprecated icon types and clean up icon system

### What Changed

- Removed deprecated icon types from iconList
- Maintained core icon system functionality while removing legacy code

This is a cleanup change that removes technical debt related to deprecated icons. No functional changes to the current icon system - this just removes unused deprecated icon support that was previously marked for removal.
