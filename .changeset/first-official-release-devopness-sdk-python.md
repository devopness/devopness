Initial stable release of the Devopness SDK for Python (v1.0.0)

This is the first official release published to PyPI.
Previous versions (0.0.x) were only available on TestPyPI
for internal testing and early integration.

Now available at: https://pypi.org/project/devopness/

The SDK allows developers to interact programmatically with the
Devopness API, providing features such as infrastructure provisioning,
server and application management, and credential handling.

Breaking changes are expected to follow semantic versioning from this point onward.
