Please make sure to read and observe our [Contributor Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Contributing Guidelines

### Getting Started
`Good first issues` are a great way to start contributing to the project and get familiar with the codebase.
Here's how to find them:

1. Visit the "[Issues](https://github.com/devopness/devopness/issues)" tab on the main [repository](https://github.com/devopness/devopness)
2. Use the "Labels" filter and select "[Good First Issue](https://github.com/devopness/devopness/labels/good%20first%20issue)" to see a list of beginner-friendly tasks
3. Choose an issue that interests you

### Forking this repository
1. [Fork the repository](https://github.com/devopness/devopness/fork) and start working on it
2. To become familiar working with forks, please read and follow the [standard fork based workflow](https://gist.github.com/Chaser324/ce0505fbed06b947d962), which could be summarized with the following steps:
  - Fork Devopness repository
  - Create a branch
  - When the changes in a branch are tested, open a pull request from your fork

### Submitting a Pull Request
1. Once you implemented a new feature or a fix for an issue, open a pull request for review
  - Please ensure all automated checks on your PR are passing, otherwise the PR will not be considered ready to be reviewed
2. **Code Review:** Your pull request will be reviewed
  - Note: you might need to make changes on your pull request based on reviewers's feedbacks
3. **Merge:** Once approved, maintainers will merge your pull request into the main repository branch

### Pull request titles
**Pull request titles should**:
- be written in the active imperative form
- not end with a period (`.`)
- be read in natural language. As a simple rule one can pretend the message in a pull request title starts with `"This change will ..."`
  - **Example**: for a pull request that has the title `fix broken links on user profile page`, it could be read as `This change will ... fix broken links on user profile page`

Here are some **bad examples** of pull requests titles we're trying to avoid:
- `Fixes a bug`
- `Adds a feature`
- `Feature now does something`

### Changelogs

The messages that appear in our changelogs are defined using changesets.

[Click here to learn what changesets are, and how to add one.](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/adding-a-changeset.md)

### Feature Work
For larger features, we would appreciate it if you open a [new issue](https://github.com/devopness/devopness/issues/new/choose) before investing a lot of your time trying to solve it, so we can discuss and plan the feature together.

Please also be sure to browse current issues to make sure your issue is unique, to lighten the triage burden on our maintainers.
Finally, please limit your pull requests to contain only one feature at a time. Separating feature work into individual pull requests helps speed up code review and reduces the barrier to merge.
