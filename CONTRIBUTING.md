## Creating an Issue

Before you create a new Issue:

1. Please search existing issues to ensure the same issue hasn't been reported before and avoid opening a duplicate.
2. If it is a bug report, include the steps needed to reproduce the issue and please create a reproducible test case on [codesandbox.io](https://codesandbox.io/), [jsfiddle.net](https://jsfiddle.net/) or [runkit.com](https://runkit.com/). Example: https://runkit.com/gr2m/5aa034f1440b420012a6eebf
3. If it is a feature request, please share the motivation for the new feature and how you would implement it.
4. Please include links to the corresponding GitHub documentation.

## Tests

If you want to submit a bug fix or new feature, make sure that all tests are passing by locally running `npm run build`.

## Making Changes and submitting Pull Requests

- Keep git commit messages clear and appropriate. Ideally, follow commit conventions described below.
- Push your changes to your topic branch in your fork of the repo.
- Submit a pull request from your topic branch to the main branch in the `@devopness/devopness` repository.
- Be sure to tag any issues your pull request is taking care of / contributing to. \* Adding "Closes #123" to a pull request description will auto close the issue once the pull request is merged in.
- Ensure the pull request passes all `checks`. If not, please fix the code until you get a green check mark on the PR.

## Merging the Pull Request & releasing a new version

Releases are automated using [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release).
The following commit message conventions determine which version is released:

1. `fix: ...` or `fix(scope name): ...` prefix in subject: bumps fix version, e.g. `1.2.3` → `0.2.4`
2. `feat: ...` or `feat(scope name): ...` prefix in subject: bumps feature version, e.g. `1.2.3` → `1.3.0`
3. `BREAKING CHANGE:` in body: bumps breaking version, e.g. `1.2.3` → `2.0.0`

Only one version number is bumped at a time, the highest version change trumps the others.
Besides publishing a new version to npm, semantic-release also creates a git tag and a release on GitHub, generates changelogs from the commit messages and puts them into the release notes.

If the pull request looks good but does not follow the commit conventions, use the "Squash & merge" button.
