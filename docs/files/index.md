title: Files
intro: |
    Configuration files are used to store configuration settings and environment variables that are used by application and infrastructure resources.

    <br/><br/>Example: a `.env` file (also known as "dotenv") containing environment variables for an `Application`).

    <br/><br/>Using Devopness you can easily manage and organize multiple configuration files on your environment resources defining custom variables to be set during a deploy, without the need of hard-coding them directly into your application code and without the need of SSH into your server every time an environment variable needs to be updated.
