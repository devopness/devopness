## What are action credits and how do I acquire them in my account?
In Devopness, a credit represents a unit used by actions created to run pipelines within a project. The number of credits consumed by a given action is based on the number of steps in the executed pipeline.

## How do I acquire credits in my account?
As a Devopness user, you are automatically on our 'Free Forever' plan, which includes a sufficient amount of credits to allow you to launch and maintain an infrastructure with few resources and little complexity. 

If you need additional credits beyond this allocation, you can upgrade your plan. We offer the 'Standard' plan with customizable pricing depending on the amount of credits you want to purchase. You can find more about this plan in our [Pricing page](https://dev-site.devopness.com/pricing/).

## What are actions?
In the context of Devopness, an "action" refers to any operation executed by the platform on user environment resources. These actions encompass various operations, such as deploying applications, configuring SSL certificates, provisioning servers, provisioning subnets and more. 

## How are credits consumed when using Devopness?
The consumption of credits is directly related to the execution of an action within Devopness platform. Each step within an action consumes a credit upon completion. As you use the platform and perform actions, your available credits decrease accordingly.

## What is the validity period of my credits?
Regardless of the plan you choose, the credits follow a monthly cycle. This means that your action credits expire when the month is over, but will renew automatically on the next month upon processing of the subscription fees. Therefore, you have access to a fresh allocation of credits at the start of each billing cycle. 

If you need additional credits before the renewal, you can upgrade your plan on our [Pricing page](https://dev-site.devopness.com/pricing/) or follow the instructions described in our [Upgrade your Devopness Subscription](https://dev-site.devopness.com/docs/users/subscriptions/upgrade-subscription/) documentation. 

## Is it possible to track or verify how much credit is used for each "action"?
A helpful way to track credit usage is by considering the total number of steps within an action. Each step completed in an action consumes one credit. 

Additionally, project owners have the privilege of monitoring the total credits used within their projects. They can also view the actions triggered by each environment within those projects, providing valuable context for credit consumption. Please note that this monitoring capability is available exclusively to project owners, and they can only access projects for which they are the owner.

## What happens if I run out of credits or do not have sufficient credits to perform an "action"?
If your credits are depleted and you require additional credits to meet your project's demands, you have the option to upgrade your subscription. This ensures that your team can continue to access all the benefits of managing your projects with Devopness. 

If you have a total of zero (0) credits, you won't be able to create any actions. In such a case, you would need to consider upgrading your plan to acquire more credits. However, if you have at least one (1) credit, you can initiate an action successfully, such as creating a resource, and all related actions will be successfully executed because the initial action was created. In essence, as long as you have at least one credit, you can trigger an action and their associated executions.

## What are the different credit plans available and how do I choose the most suitable one for my needs?
Devopness offers two primary subscription plans. The "Free forever" plan is a no-cost option that includes a monthly allocation of 50 action credits, which renew each month. The "Standard" plan provides pricing options that are tailored to your specific requirements, starting from a minimum of 200 action credits. 

You can review the features available in each plan on our [Pricing page](https://dev-site.devopness.com/pricing/) to determine the plan that best aligns with your project's needs.

## Can I upgrade or change my plan at any time?
Yes, you have the flexibility to upgrade your subscription plan at any time within the Devopness platform. Upgrading allows you to access additional features and resources to support your project's growth. Detailed instructions on how to upgrade your account can be found in our [Upgrade your Devopness Subscription](https://dev-site.devopness.com/docs/users/subscriptions/upgrade-subscription/).

## How do the automatic renewal processes for credits and subscription plans work?
For users on a monthly plan, the renewal process is initiated at the beginning of each billing cycle. This process involves amending your fees payable based on your chosen plan and the usage of action credits during the previous billing period. Automatic renewal ensures uninterrupted access to the Devopness platform and its features.

## How can I cancel my plan?
If you decide to cancel your subscription plan, you can do so by logging into your account within our Devopness Platform. Upon cancellation, your plan will remain active until the end of the current paid term. It's important to note that no refunds will be provided for our subscription services. 

Detailed instructions on how to cancel your plan can be found in our [Cancel Active Subscription Plan](https://dev-site.devopness.com/docs/users/subscriptions/cancel-subscription/) documentation.
