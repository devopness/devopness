<details><summary><strong>How do I acquire credits in my account?</strong></summary><br>
As a Devopness user, you are automatically on our 'Free Forever' plan, which includes a sufficient amount of credits to allow you to launch and maintain an infrastructure with few resources and little complexity. 
<br>
<br>
If you need additional credits beyond this allocation, you can upgrade your plan. We offer the 'Standard' plan with customizable pricing depending on the amount of credits you want to purchase. You can find more about this plan in our Pricing page [insert link].

<summary><strong>How are credits consumed when using Devopness?</strong></summary><br>
The consumption of credits is directly related to the execution of an action within Devopness platform. Each step within an action consumes a credit upon completion. As you use the platform and perform actions, your available credits decrease accordingly.
<br>
<br>
These actions encompass various operations, such as deploying applications, configuring SSL certificates, provisioning servers, provisioning subnets and more.

<summary><strong>How are "actions" related to the use of credits in my account?</strong></summary><br>
In the context of Devopness, an "action" refers to any operation executed by the platform on user environment resources. These actions encompass a wide range of tasks, including resource provisioning, configuration management, and deployment tasks. The availability of action credits in your account determines whether an action can be performed. If you have sufficient action credits, the platform can execute the action; otherwise, it will not proceed.

<details>
<summary><strong>What is the validity period of my credits?</strong></summary><br>
Regardless of the plan you choose, the credits follow a monthly cycle. This means that your action credits expire when the month is over, but will renew automatically on the next month upon processing of the subscription fees. Therefore, you have access to a fresh allocation of credits at the start of each billing cycle. 
<br>
<br>
If you need additional credits before the renewal, you can upgrade your plan on our Pricing page [insert link] or follow the instructions described in our 'Upgrade your Devopness Subscription' [insert link] documentation.

<details>
<summary><strong>Is it possible to track or verify how much credit is used for each "action"?</strong></summary><br>
A helpful way to track credit usage is by considering the total number of steps within an action. Each step completed in an action consumes one credit. 
<br>
<br>
Additionally, project owners have the privilege of monitoring the total credits used within their projects. They can also view the actions triggered by each environment within those projects, providing valuable context for credit consumption. Please note that this monitoring capability is available exclusively to project owners, and they can only access projects for which they are the owner.

<summary><strong>What happens if I run out of credits or do not have sufficient credits to perform an "action"?</strong></summary><br>
If your credits are depleted and you require additional credits to meet your project's demands, you have the option to upgrade your subscription. This ensures that your team can continue to access all the benefits of managing your projects with Devopness. 
<br>
<br>
If you have a total of zero (0) credits, you won't be able to create any actions. In such a case, you would need to consider upgrading your plan to acquire more credits. However, if you have at least one (1) credit, you can initiate an action successfully, such as creating a resource, and all related actions will be successfully executed because the initial action was created. In essence, as long as you have at least one credit, you can trigger an action and their associated executions.

<summary><strong>What are the different credit plans available and how do I choose the most suitable one for my needs?</strong></summary><br>
Devopness offers two primary subscription plans. The "Free forever" plan is a no-cost option that includes a monthly allocation of 50 action credits, which renew each month. The "Standard" plan provides pricing options that are tailored to your specific requirements, starting from a minimum of 200 action credits.

<summary><strong>How do the automatic renewal processes for credits and subscription plans work?</strong></summary><br>

Automatic renewal ensures uninterrupted access to the Devopness platform and its features.
