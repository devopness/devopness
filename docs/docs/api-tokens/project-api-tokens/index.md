Project API Tokens provide RBAC (Role-based Access Control) to resources within a single project.

They allow fine grained permission management using RBAC (Role-based Access Control) and are a secure way to interact with Devopness API from external tools, automation scripts, and from any integrations that should only be allowed access to resources of a specific Devopness project.
