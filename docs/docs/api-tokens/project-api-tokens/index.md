Permissions are defined by the role assigned to the token, making them ideal for automation's, scripts, or integrations that should not access resources outside the project.

## Usage

:::info

Include the token in all project-related requests using the `Authorization` header:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer <your_api_token>
```
