## How to View Details of an SSH Key

1. In the Devopness dashboard, navigate to your project, then select the environment where the SSH key was added.
2. Locate the `SSH Keys` card and click `View` to open the list of SSH keys associated with the environment.
3. From the list, click on the SSH key you want to inspect.
4. The `SSH key` details page will display important information such as:
   - **Name**: A user-friendly name for the key.
   - **Fingerprint**: A unique identifier for the key.
   - **Created At**: When the key was added to the environment.

Use this view to verify key details or to confirm which keys have access to your servers.
