## How to List SSH Keys

1. In the Devopness dashboard, navigate to your desired project, then select the relevant environment.
2. Locate the `SSH Keys` card on the environment page.
3. Click the `View` button on the `SSH Keys` card to display the list of SSH keys currently added to the environment.
4. If no keys are listed, follow the steps in the [Create SSH Key Pair](../ssh-keys/create-ssh-key-pair) and [Add SSH Key](../ssh-keys/add-ssh-key) guides to add your first key.
