title: Daemons
intro: Many applications rely on background processes, or daemons, to keep critical programs alive and running continuously. Devopness simplifies the management of these daemons by providing a centralized platform, allowing you to configure, monitor, and maintain these persistent processes with ease. Daemons run as background processes and can automatically restart a program if it fails or when its code/command line is modified.
