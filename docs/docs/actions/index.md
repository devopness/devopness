## What are actions and action steps?
An “action” is the execution of a pipeline.

As in our daily routine of managing software projects we need to “take an action” to fix or improve something, that’s exactly what Devopness does for you and your team:
- Devopness executes actions in an automated, predictable and reliable way, so your team can get repetitive tasks done without manual work

Each step in a pipeline becomes an action step, that is then executed by Devopness according to how a pipeline was configured at that point in time.

For your convenience, each action step output log is made available for you in Devopness action details view.
