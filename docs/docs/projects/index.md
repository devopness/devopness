## When to use a new project

Projects are the top-level boundary for teams, roles, and permissions. Use them to isolate who can access what and to group related environments.

Use a new project when:
- The applications belong to different products or business units.
- The teams and permissions should be different.

Use the same project when:
- Multiple applications are part of the same product and share the same team.
- You want to manage environments, roles, and permissions once.

Examples:
- Same project: `www.my-product.ai`, `demo.my-product.ai`, and `agent-server` are parts of the same product and run by the same team.
- Separate projects: `app-a` and `app-b` are independent products with different teams.

You can always add another project later if your boundaries change.
