1. On Devopness upper-left corner, click the Devopness logo to see a list of existing projects
1. On the upper-right corner of the list click `ADD PROJECT`
1. Provide a name to the `Project` being added. For example, "My Product"
1. Click `CONFIRM`
  - You will be redirected to the `Project resources` page, with details of your newly created project
  - You can now manage `Environments`, `Teams` and `Roles` in your new project

Tips:
- Create a new project for each product when teams and permissions should be isolated.
- Use a new project if you need different Git or cloud provider credentials.
- Keep multiple applications in the same project when they belong to the same product and are managed by the same teams.
