Each membership acts as a link between three key components:

1.  **Team:** The group of users receiving access.
2.  **Environment:** The resource being accessed.
3.  **Role:** The set of permissions the team will have within that specific environment.

Before you can create a team membership, you must ensure your project has the necessary teams and roles already configured.
