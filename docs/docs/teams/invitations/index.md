## Team Invitations

Team invitations are a way to invite new members to join your project teams. When you invite someone to a team, they receive an email invitation that allows them to join the project and collaborate on the environments that the team has access to.

### Available Actions

- **[Add Team Member](add-invitation.md)**: Send an invitation to a new team member
- **[List Team Invitations](list-invitations.md)**: View all pending and completed invitations

### Invitation Process

1. **Send Invitation**: Project owners can invite new members by providing their email address
2. **Email Notification**: The invited member receives an email with a link to accept the invitation
3. **Accept Invitation**: The member clicks the link and creates their Devopness account
4. **Team Access**: Once accepted, the member gains access to all environments the team has permissions for

### Managing Invitations

You can view all invitations for a team, including their status (Pending, Accepted, Expired) and take actions like resending or canceling invitations as needed.
