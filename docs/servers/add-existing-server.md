1. On Devopness, navigate to a project then select an environment
1. If there's no other server in the selected environment, just click `Add Server`
1. If a list of resource cards is displayed, find the `Servers` card
1. Click `View` in the `Servers` card to see a list of existing `Servers`
1. On the upper-right corner of the list click `ADD SERVER`

1. Provide the `Public IP address` of your existing server
1. Enter the `SSH Port` to be used to connect to the server

    {% note %}

    **NOTE**: we do not recommend connecting servers that are already being used in production. Server's existing configuration will be lost and replaced by Devopness during the server setup process

    {% endnote %}

1. Click `NEXT`
1. Follow the prompts to complete the configuration of the new `Server`
1. Click `CONFIRM`
    - If you see a message saying `Error establishing a SSH connection to server`, please verify if the IP address and SSH port used are correct and if external SSH connections are allowed on this server
1. After the `Server` is added you will be redirected to the `Connect` page
1. Find the `Command to connect` field and click `Copy to clipboard`
1. Log into your server as the `root` user
1. Paste the command that has been copied to the clipboard and run it
1. A message will be displayed in the terminal window when the server connect command is successfully completed
1. On Devopness, once the server is displayed as `Connected`, it's been added to the selected environment
