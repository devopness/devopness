title: Variables
---

Variables are used to store configuration settings that are used by application and infrastructure resources.

For example, a `PORT` variable can define the port on which the application listens for incoming requests.

Using Devopness you can easily manage and organize multiple variables on your environment resources defining custom variables to be set during a deploy, without the need of hard-coding them directly into your application code and without the need of SSH into your server every time an environment variable needs to be updated.
