name: Sync - Package Versions

# This workflow is responsible for synchronizing the versions of Devopness packages that are
# not published to npm but are managed by changesets. These packages have a package.json file
# solely for version management purposes, even though they are not npm packages.
#
# For example, Python packages use this workflow to sync the version specified in their
# pyproject.toml file with the version managed by changesets in the package.json file.
#
# Additionally, to avoid errors during changeset operations, this workflow ensures that the
# versions of these packages are also synchronized in the root package-lock.json file.
